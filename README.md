# Fake-Voice-Detection
## Introduction
This repository provides a Python implementation of a Conformer model for fake speech detection, trained on the ASVspoof2019 dataset. The Conformer model is a state-of-the-art neural network architecture that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), making it well-suited for tasks like speech recognition and audio classification.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- NumPy
- SciPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Librosa
- tqdm
## Dataset
The ASVspoof2019 dataset is required for training and evaluation. You can download it from the official ASVspoof website: 
http://www.asvspoof.org/index2019.html

## Usage
$ Clone the Repository:

$ Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-speech-detection-conformer.git
Use code with caution.

## Install Dependencies:

- Bash
- pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

## Prepare the Data:

Create a directory structure to organize your data. For example:
- data/
├── train/
│   ├── genuine/
│   └── spoof/
└── test/
Place the ASVspoof2019 dataset files into the appropriate directories.


## Model Architecture
The Conformer model used in this project consists of the following components:

- **Convolutional Module**: Applies convolutional layers to extract local features from the input audio.
- **Attention Module**: Uses attention mechanisms to focus on important parts of the input sequence.
- **Feed-Forward Module**: A fully connected layer that transforms the features.
- **Positional Encoding**: Encodes positional information into the input sequence to help the model capture temporal dependencies.
